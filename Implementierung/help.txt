Denoise - Image Noise Reduction Program
Usage: ./denoise [options]... [file]

Options:
    -V <integer>: Set the implementation version of the program. Default is SIMD.
                  0: SIMD, 1: integer SISD, 2: accurate SISD
    -B <integer>: Measures and outputs the runtime of the denoise process. 
                  Optional argument for repetition. Default is no repetition.
    -o <string>:  Generates an output file in PGM format with the specified name.
    -c, --coeff <float,float,float>: 
                  Set the coefficients of the grayscale conversion a, b, and c. Default values used if not set.
    -t:           Run functional and performance tests (for debug purposes). No input file needed if set.
    -h, --help:   Display this help message.

Notes:
-   Input image must be in 24bpp PPM (P6) format.
-   Only 0, 1 or 2 are allowed as an argument for the option -V.
-   integer SISD is faster but may alter pixel values by Â±1 compared to accurate SISD.
-   To enable the default SIMD implementation, ensure your CPU supports SSE4 extension. Otherwise, set the option "-V" to 1 or 2.
-   Argument of option -B must be greater than 0.
-   If -o option is not set, a file named "output.pgm" will be created and used as the output image.
-   If -t option is set, other valid options are ignored and the program do not denoise any image.
-   Default coefficients for grayscale conversion are the Rec. 709 luma coefficients.
-   Output image is in 8bpp PGM (P5) format.

Examples:
    ./denoise image.ppm: 
        Reduce noise of "image.ppm" using SIMD and write to output file "output.pgm".
    ./denoise -V 1 -B 50 -o image_denoised.pgm image.ppm: 
        Use integer SISD, repeat 50 times, measure runtime, and write to "image_denoised.pgm".
    ./denoise -V 2 -B --coeff 3.2,5.9,0.9 image.ppm: 
        Use accurate SISD, use (3.2R+5.9G+0.9B)/(3.2+5.9+0.9) for grayscale conversion, no repeat, measure runtime, write to "output.pgm"
